I am a research-oriented Master's student in the School of Electronic Science and Technology at Nanjing University. I am fortuate to be co-advised by [Prof. Zhou](https://zhouyou-nju.github.io/) and [Prof. Cao](https://cite.nju.edu.cn/People/Faculty/20190621/i5054.html), with a research focus on **Computational Imaging** and **Light Microscopy**. My current research centers on developing **efficient and high-fidelity volumetric microscopy imaging methods**. I am passionate about bridging the gap between advanced algorithms and novel optical encoding techniques to overcome fundamental imaging challenges. 

More information about me and my work will be posted soon!
